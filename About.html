            <p>About Me <br>
                Thank you for visiting my world. I'm a 36 year old real estate broker in Rocky Hill, CT. Outside of helping people buy and sell real estate I truly enjoy coaching kids in the community and challenging myself to try new things. One of my goals is to develop an app that will revolutionize the way people buy and sell real estate.</p>

            <p>Real Estate<br>
                As a kid I was always fascinated with big houses and sifting through the Real Estate Book admiring the properties and agents advertising them. I started my real estate career out of high school after I got a job working at a general practice law firm that had a specialty in real estate. It wasn't until 2017 that I started my own real estate company and began working for myself.</p>

            <p>Coaching<br>
                I believe it is important to stay involved in your community any way possible. One way that I give back is by coaching youth basketball. I've been coaching since 2001. What first started as just community service, transformed into a passion of mine. I really enjoy coaching youth basketball at all levels. I just finished the 8th Grade Travel Season in Newington and also coach for an AAU Basketball Program in Meriden called WER1.</p>
